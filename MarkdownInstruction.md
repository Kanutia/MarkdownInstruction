# Instruction for work with Markdown

## Highlighting text

For highlighting text with cursive you need to use stars (*) or the signs of underlining (_) around the text. For example *like this* or _this_

For highlighting the text fat you need to use 2 stars or 2 underlining signs around the text. For example **like this** or __this__

Alternative possibilities of highlighting the text are combining fat and cursive. Like: _**this text ist at same time fat and cursive**_

## Lists

For highlighting a list use stars

For adding not numbered lists you need to highlight the points with a star (*)

* element1
* element2
* element3

For adding numbered lists you need to use numbers, like:

1. first point
2. second point

## Work with images

For adding and image into the text, write this:

![text instead of image](file name) 

For example:
! [image](Screenshot(5).png)
